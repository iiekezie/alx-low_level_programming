## 0x0C. C - More Malloc, free ##

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING School**. It aims to learn about More Malloc, Free Project in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### NOTE All the files within this Folder are made executable ###

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |  Prototype  |

| `0. Trust no one` | Write a function that allocates memory using malloc. | void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b); |
| `1. string_nconcat` | Write a function that concatenates two strings. | char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n); |
| `2. _calloc` |  Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc. | void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size); | 
| `3. array_range` |  Write a function that creates an array of integers. | int *array_range(int min, int max); | 
| `4. _realloc` |  Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free | void *_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int old_size, unsigned int new_size); | 
| `5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope` | Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers. | Usage: mul num1 num2 |
