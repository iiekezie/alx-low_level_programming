## 0x12. C - Singly linked lists ##

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING School**. It aims to learn about Singly linked lists in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Type/File                  |   Definition                     |Prototype                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |---------------------------------------------- |
|`0-print_list.c` |	`Prints all elements of a list_t list.`	| size_t print_list(const list_t *h); |
|`1-list_len.c` |	`Returns the number of elements in a list_t list.` |	size_t list_len(const list_t *h); |
|`2-add_node.c` |	`Adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.` |	list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str); |
|`3-add_node_end.c` |	`Adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.`	| list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char |*str); |
|`4-free_list.c` |	`Frees a list_t list.` |	void free_list(list_t *head); |
|`100-first.c` |	`Prints a message before main function is executed.`	| (No prototype as it runs before main) |
|`101-hello_holberton.asm` |	`A 64-bit assembly program to print a message.` |	(No prototype as it's written in assembly) |


## `These tasks cover various aspects of working with singly linked lists, printing messages, and writing assembly code`

---

### Please note that the last two tasks do not have explicit C prototypes, as they involve other languages (plain text and assembly) and the execution behavior of the program.
