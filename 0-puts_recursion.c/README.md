# C - Recursion

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about C - Recursion in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `File 0-puts_recursion.c` | is a function that prints a string, followed by a  `New Line` |
| `File 1-print_rev_recursion.c` | is a function that prints a string in reverse. |
| `File 2-strlen_recursion.c` | is a function that returns the length of a string. |
| `File 3-factorial.c` | is a function that returns the factorial of a given number. |
| `File 4-pow_recursion.c` | is a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. |
| `File 5-sqrt_recursion.c`  | is a function that returns the natural square root of a number. |
| `File 6-is_prime_number.c` | is a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0. |
| `File 100-is_palindrome.c` | is a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. |
| `File 101-wildcmp.c` | is a function that compares two strings and returns 1 |
| `File _putchar.c` | is a file containing the _putchar function. |
| `File main.h` | is the header file containing the function prototypes. |
