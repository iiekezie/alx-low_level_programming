# 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings **C language**.

##  General Requirements `C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings`
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

## TASKS
All of the following files are programs written in C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-strcat.c` | is a function that concatenates two strings.|
| `1-strncat.c` |  is a function that concatenates two strings that will use at most n bytes from src.|
| `2-strncpy.c` | is a function that copies a string. |
| `3-strcmp.c` | is a function that compares two strings. |
| `4-rev_array.c` | a function that reverses the content of an array of integers. |
| `5-string_toupper.c` | is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. |
| `6-cap_string.c` | is a function that capitalizes all words of a string. |
| `7-leet.c` | is a function that encodes a string into 1337. |
| `100-rot13.c` |is a function that encodes a string using rot13. |
| `_putchar.c` | is a function that replaces the standard library function putchar(). |
| `main.h` | is the header file containing all the function prototypes. |
