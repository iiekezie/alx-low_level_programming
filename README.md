# ALX Low-Level Programming & Algorithm

Module of **ALX Low-level Programming** and **Algorithm**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering Studies** at **[ALX School](https://github.com/iiekezie/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master)**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* You are allowed to use _putchar
