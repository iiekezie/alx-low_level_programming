# Project README: 0x14 - C Bit Manipulation

This project is part of the **0x14. C - Bit manipulation** curriculum at **ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING School**. It focuses on developing your understanding of bit manipulation and bitwise operators in the **C programming language**. The project consists of several tasks that require you to create functions to manipulate binary numbers and bits.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Ifeanyi I Ekezie

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:


## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* You are allowed to use _putchar

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

| Task | Description | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. | [0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/0-binary_to_uint.c) |
| 1 | Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. | [1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/1-print_binary.c) |
| 2 | Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. | [2-get_bit.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/2-get_bit.c) |
| 3 | Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. | [3-set_bit.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/3-set_bit.c) |
| 4 | Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. | [4-clear_bit.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/4-clear_bit.c) |
| 5 | Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. | [5-flip_bits.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/5-flip_bits.c) |
| 6 (Advanced) | Write a function that checks the endianness. | [100-get_endianness.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/100-get_endianness.c) |
| 7 (Advanced) | Find the password for this program and save it in the file 101-password. | [101-password](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation/blob/master/101-password) |

## Usage

To compile and test these functions, you can use the provided test files in the repository, as shown in the examples in the task descriptions. You can adapt these tests for your own verification.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of bit manipulation and bitwise operators in C. By completing the tasks, you will gain valuable experience in working with binary representations and manipulating individual bits in integers. Enjoy the learning process and happy coding!
