## 0x0F. C - Variadic functions ##

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING School**. It aims to learn about C - Variadic functions Project in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* You are allowed to use _putchar

### NOTE All the files within this Folder are made executable ###

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description | Prototype  |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant` |Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. |int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...); |
| `1. To be is to be the value of a variable` | Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. |void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...); |
| `2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable` |Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. |void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...); |
| `3. To be is a to be the value of a variable` |Write a function that prints anything. |void print_all(const char * const format, ...); |
