# C - Debugging

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about C - Debugging **C language**.

##  General Requirements `C - Debugging`
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

## TASKS
All of the following files are programs written in C - Debugging:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. Multiple mains` | In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project |
| `1. Like, comment, subscribe` | Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. |
| `2. 0 > 972?` | This program prints the largest of three integers. |
| `3. Leap year` | This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. |
