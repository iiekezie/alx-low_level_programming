# Project Overview
This project focuses on learning about Makefiles in C programming. It involves creating Makefiles to automate the compilation process of C programs, understand the use of rules, variables, and cleaning procedures.

## Technologies
- C
- Make

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Version of gcc: 9.3.0
- Version of make: GNU Make 4.2.1
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory

## Tasks
| Task Number | File Name         | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0           | 0-Makefile        | Create a basic Makefile without any variables or advanced features                                           |
| 1           | 1-Makefile        | Improve the Makefile by introducing variables for the compiler and source files                              |
| 2           | 2-Makefile        | Enhance the Makefile to include object files and specify the name of the executable                            |
| 3           | 3-Makefile        | Add cleaning rules to the Makefile such as clean, oclean, fclean, and re                                       |
| 4           | 4-Makefile        | Further refine the Makefile by adding compiler flags and stricter cleaning rules                               |
| 5           | 5-island_perimeter.py | Implement a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island based on a grid representation           |
| 6           | 100-Makefile      | Advanced Makefile with additional constraints and requirements                                                 |

## C Scripts
